# File-Header-Comment Helper for Visual Studio Code
This is a, super-simple, extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that was created to simplify the task of adding file-header-comments to source files.

## What good is this?
Adding file-header-comments is easy, and is done quite a bit by us programmers, so, why can't the machine help, and do some of the work for us?

Before this extension, pretty much every time I created a file, I'd add a file-header-comment, doing one of the following...

 - Copy an existing comment, and replace certain values
 - Write a whole new comment, from scratch

Neither of the items listed, are difficult, and they don't take much time, however, when you're really in the zone as a programmer, you probably don't want to have to deal with something as silly as a file-header-comment.

What this extension does, is take advantage of Visual Studio Code's (quite powerful) extension framework, along with its configuration system, to provide a simple(r) system to help you create file-header-comments.

The question "what good is this", cannot really be answered, because the "answer" to it, will always be an opinion.

Yes, I also have an opinion about this extension, but I won't offer-it-up, because I created the extension, which, in turn, means I'm probably biased.

### **tl;dr**: You'll have to try this, and "answer" that question for yourself.

## How do I use this?

 - Coming soon...
